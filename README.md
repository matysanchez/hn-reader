#hn-reader

A (another one) Hacker News reader. Really minimalist and beautiful.

This reader use only JS to work. And.. kimono API. Nothing else.
Using (skeleton)[http://www.getskeleton.com/] as CSS base framework. Yes, it's reponsive!

##Focus on the important:: the news

If you are a Hacker News reader, but you don't like to submit your links, adding comments, and of course you don't care about the points of every news, this is your perfect reader.
